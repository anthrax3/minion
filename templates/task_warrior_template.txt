About this Template
--------------------
You'll want to remove this section from the template, once you're familiar with it. Alternately, simply copy and rename the file, excluding this section from the copy.

This template expects integration with TaskWarrior, through a tool for running the current line from the command line and pasting the output into the buffer below. 
	
This integration can be accomplished with a simple alias in your ~/.vimrc.

If you prefer to use a plugin, http://github.com/edthedev/cmd.vim is one that will work.

Managing Other's Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you manage other people, you may want to add an 'owner' field to the TaskWarrior ~/.taskrc::

	uda.owner.type=string
	uda.owner.label=Owner

To assign a task to another user::

	!task add owner:username task description here.

To reassign a task::

	!task 13 modify owner:username

Keep this single line (for each team member) in the file somewhere::

	>task owner:<owner_name> list

With Cmd.vim, pressing <Leader>cc with the cursor on that line with generate and paste text from TaskWarrior that looks something like::

	ID Owner  Proj    Age Description
	-- ------ ------- --- -------------------------------------
	 2 owner1 project 1d  Do somethings.
	 3 owner1 project 1d  Do some other things.

	2 tasks

You can also create and use fairly complex queries::

    >task owner:john or owner:jane or project:project_1 list

To use this template:

1. Make a copy of this file with a different name, such as 'my_taskwarrior.template'.
2. In the copy, update the section below with project names and team member names you wish to track.
3. Remove the this entire 'About this template' section from the copy.
4. Call minion daily as needed to use the template::

	>minion template my_taskwarrior
